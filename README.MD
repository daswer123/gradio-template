## About the Project

This project serves as an example of how to build an application using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for creating interactive web interfaces, with a strong focus on a modular architecture, state management, user-configurable settings, database-driven configuration, and a dedicated connection manager to handle module interactions. The code is structured to facilitate easy integration of new modules, settings, and inter-module connectivity.

Key highlights include:

1. **Modular Architecture**: All functionality is split into separate modules, making the codebase more maintainable, scalable, and reusable.
2. **State Management**: A central state manager and configuration system provides a single source of truth for the entire application, simplifying data sharing between modules.
3. **Dynamic UI Generation**: The interface is dynamically created and configured using Gradio, with tabs, input/output components, and custom event handlers.
4. **Module Connection Manager**: A dedicated manager handles how modules interact with one another, allowing outputs from one module to serve as inputs to another with minimal effort.
5. **Database-Driven Settings**: Application settings (logging level, theme, host, port, etc.) are stored in a `user.db` SQLite database. Default settings are created on first run, and can be updated dynamically.
6. **Component-Based UI Approach**: Each module defines its own UI components and event logic. This isolation simplifies complex UI creation and encourages code reuse.
7. **Example Modules**: The project includes simple text processing and display modules, as well as a more complex, multi-file approach. The `_simple` suffix in filenames denotes a simpler, single-file component implementation.

## Components and Their Roles

- **app.py**:  
  - The application’s entry point.  
  - Creates an `Application` instance, initializes all modules, and launches the Gradio interface.
  - Defines `MODULE_CONNECTIONS` that specify how modules interact.

- **app_configuration**:  
  - `app_config.py` – Handles top-level initialization, setting up core components and modules.  
  - `settings.py` – Defines the default application settings (theme, logging, host/port, etc.).  
  - `state.py` – Manages the application’s global state, settings, and database interactions. Loads/synchronizes settings and provides a unified place for modules to store and retrieve data.
  - `models.py` – Contains helper enums and data structures, such as `LogLevel`.

- **modules**:  
  - `base.py` – Abstract base class for modules, defining essential module methods and structure.
  - `connection_manager.py` – Implements `ModuleConnectionManager` to handle registering modules and their interconnections.
  - `test_loader.py` – Demonstrates asynchronous text processing with cancellation and progress updates.
  - `text_processor_simple.py` – A simple one-file example: input text is converted to uppercase.
  - `text_display/` (Complex Example):
    - `ui.py` – Defines UI components (textbox, button, markdown display).
    - `handlers.py` – Contains event handlers (e.g., refresh button logic).
    - `functions.py` – Business logic to retrieve and format data from the global state.
    - `base.py` – Integrates UI, handlers, and functions into a cohesive `TextDisplay` module.

- **utils**:  
  - `database.py` – Database class handling SQLite operations for storing application settings.
  - `logger.py` – A unified logger that supports different log levels and module/source tags.

## Inter-Module Communication

The `ModuleConnectionManager` allows easy specification of how modules interact. For example, in `app.py`:

```python
MODULE_CONNECTIONS = [
   ("proc1", "display1", "display_text"),
]
```

This means the output from `proc1` (TextProcessor) will be available as input to `display1` (TextDisplay). This setup encourages a clean architecture where each module can remain independent, and all wiring between them is managed in a single configuration point.

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The console will show where the Gradio interface is available, typically at [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860).

3. Open your browser and go to this URL. You’ll see tabs, text inputs, buttons for processing, and areas to display results.

## Application Settings

All settings (theme, logging level, port, etc.) are stored in `user.db`. On first run, default settings are initialized. You can manually change them later or adjust how they’re loaded and updated in `state.py`.

## Conclusion

This template provides a foundation for building more complex applications:

- Add new modules, each with its own logic, UI, and event handling.
- Extend the state management system or implement new logic in `state.py`.
- Customize module interactions via `ModuleConnectionManager`.
- Leverage Gradio for user-friendly interactive UIs wrapping complex server-side logic.

By following a modular approach, the code is better structured, more flexible, and easier to extend and maintain.
